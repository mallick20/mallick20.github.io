Translation of Indian Languages have long been a difficult task due to the lack of texts in different languages which can be used for translation. Here, we look at the problem relating to translation of OOV (out-of-vocabulary) words in languages having similar phonetic representation. 

The problem of OOV words is widespread in indian languages, as expected due to the lack of data. However, for some pairs like Hindi-Bhojpuri having phonetic similarity in the sturucture of words, a certain transduction approach can be used to translate OOV words. 

The transduction module learns the representation difference between the input and the output language and uses the phonetic similarity to create the word in output language.
