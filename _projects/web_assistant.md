This is a personal project which aims at leveraging RAG to customize NLP task responses on the academic details of particular user. For example, a student asking questions to a Language Model about Linear Algebra only wishes to know explanations or theories which have been covered in the class so far. Or the student might wish to research on a specific Machine Learning Algorithm but wishes that the paper revolving around content covered in the course. This type of problems can be solved by using a retrieval mechanism for augmenting the query given to the LLM with information about that particular course content.
