"At Least 500 Million Tweets Are Sent Every Day", according to The Social Shepherd. 
In the lines of this social world, it is essential that tweets are tracked according to what our needs and interests. The project aims to build a system to display tweets related to their non-profit status.

This is a text classification task where tweets are segregated based on their non-profit sector. We use a Hierarchical Text Classification approach because we have to identify three classes - Non-Profit, Call-of-Grant and Health-Education.
