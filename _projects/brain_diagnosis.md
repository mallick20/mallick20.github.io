The research work deals with the use of advanced techniques such as deep learning and machine learning to solve an important problem in the field of Biomedical Imaging. With the advancement of AI, the tools of deep learning have been providing tremendous breakthroughs in the various domains. This research work has been done to study the help of deep learning in one of the important arenas of MRI.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging is an imaging technique of the body, which uses artificial magnetic field, magnetic field gradients and radio waves and its interaction with the body to create a 2-D grey scale image of organs of the body.

Most deep learning strategies used in MRI image acquisition are based on the traditional methods described above. Image Reconstruction from under-sampled image is one of the popular tasks where deep learning has been used. Other tasks of transforming the k-space into a sampled form has also been used.
