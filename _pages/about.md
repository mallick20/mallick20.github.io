<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a graduate student pursuing Masters in Data Science at Rutgers University.

Prior to starting my graduate education, I worked as a Data Scientist in the industry, specifically in the BFSI domain. I have over three years of experience delivering end to end projects in analytics like developing classification models for payment behavior, creating customer engagement campaigns, and improving call strategies through predictive analytics. In my recent role as Senior Data Scientist, I led AI and NLP-driven projects that enhanced operational efficiency and risk management strategies.

My research interests currently revolve around themes of Explainable AI, Privacy and NLP use-cases. I am also learning more into statistical theory involving bayesian statistics and its impact on AI.

Outside of work, I have a keen interest in physics and mathematics and would love to learn a new theory or watch a 3Blue1Brown video.
