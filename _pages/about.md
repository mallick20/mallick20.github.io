<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a Data Scientist currently working in one of the leading financial services provider to sub-prime customers. 
Broadly, my current work revolves around using NLP techniques on document intelligence, customer interaction to improve the overall operations and compliance process. One of the critical aspects I work on risk identification from customers' interaction and helping with quicket turnaround and resolve time.
Prior to this, I was working on building analytics models and strategies to improve the business process.

Outside of work, I have a keen interest in physics and mathematics. I like to watch a lot of these videos in my free time.
