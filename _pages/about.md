<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a graduate student pursuing Masters in Data Science at Rutgers University. As a grad student I am diving deeper into statistical modelling, regression and non-linear models. On the other hand, I am working on AI projects through internship.

Prior to starting my graduate education, I worked as a Data Scientist in the Operations Analysis working on projects encompassing analytics, strategies and predictive modelling. Concurrently, I also led AI and NLP-driven projects that enhanced operational efficiency and risk management strategies.

Outside of AI, I have a keen interest in physics and mathematics and would be analysing a new scenario of relativity or watching a calculus video by Grant Sanderson.
